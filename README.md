# elastos-trinity-plugins-device

This plugin defines a global `device` object, which describes the device's hardware and software.
Although the object is in the global scope, it is not available until after the `deviceready` event.

```js
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);
function onDeviceReady() {
    console.log(device.cordova);
}
```

## Installation

    The plugins field of dapp manifest.json adds Device values, such as "plugins": ["XXXX", "Device", "XXXX"]

## Properties

- device.cordova
- device.model
- device.platform
- device.uuid
- device.version
- device.manufacturer
- device.isVirtual
- device.serial

## device.cordova

Get the version of Cordova running on the device.

### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

## device.model

The `device.model` returns the name of the device's model or
product. The value is set by the device manufacturer and may be
different across versions of the same product.

### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

### Quick Example

```js
// Android:    Nexus One       returns "Passion" (Nexus One code name)
//             Motorola Droid  returns "voles"
// iOS:     for the iPad Mini, returns iPad2,5; iPhone 5 is iPhone 5,1. See http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Models
//
var model = device.model;
```

### Android Quirks

- Gets the [product name](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#PRODUCT) instead of the [model name](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#MODEL), which is often the production code name. For example, the Nexus One returns `Passion`, and Motorola Droid returns `voles`.

## device.platform

Get the device's operating system name.

```js
var string = device.platform;
```
### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

### Quick Example

```js
// Depending on the device, a few examples are:
//   - "Android"
//   - "iOS"
var devicePlatform = device.platform;
```

## device.uuid

Get the device's Universally Unique Identifier ([UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier)).

```js
var string = device.uuid;
```

### Description

The details of how a UUID is generated are determined by the device manufacturer and are specific to the device's platform or model.

### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

### Quick Example

```js
// Android: Returns a random 64-bit integer (as a string, again!)
//          The integer is generated on the device's first boot
//
// iPhone: (Paraphrased from the UIDevice Class documentation)
//         Returns the [UIDevice identifierForVendor] UUID which is unique and the same for all apps installed by the same vendor. However the UUID can be different if the user deletes all apps from the vendor and then reinstalls it.
var deviceID = device.uuid;
```

### iOS Quirk

The `uuid` on iOS uses the identifierForVendor property. It is unique to the device across the same vendor, but will be different for different vendors and will change if all apps from the vendor are deleted and then reinstalled.
Refer [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIDevice/identifierForVendor) for details.
The UUID will be the same if app is restored from a backup or iCloud as it is saved in preferences. Users using older versions of this plugin will still receive the same previous UUID generated by another means as it will be retrieved from preferences.

## device.version

Get the operating system version.

    var string = device.version;

### Supported Platforms

- Android 2.1+
- iOS

### Quick Example

```js
// Android:    Froyo OS would return "2.2"
//             Eclair OS would return "2.1", "2.0.1", or "2.0"
//             Version can also return update level "2.1-update1"
//
// iPhone:     iOS 3.2 returns "3.2"
//
var deviceVersion = device.version;
```

## device.manufacturer

Get the device's manufacturer.

    var string = device.manufacturer;

### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS

### Quick Example

```js
// Android:    Motorola XT1032 would return "motorola"
// iPhone:     returns "Apple"
//
var deviceManufacturer = device.manufacturer;
```

## device.isVirtual

whether the device is running on a simulator.

```js
var isSim = device.isVirtual;
```

### Supported Platforms

- Android 2.1+
- iOS

## device.serial

Get the device hardware serial number ([SERIAL](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.html#SERIAL)).

```js
var string = device.serial;
```

### Supported Platforms

- Android
